![CAF Hackathon Header](/media/caf-hackathon-header.png)

In this challenge we want to talk about the landing zone and the first two CAF modules.

## Challenge 3 First deployment - learn some aspects of operating the platform

In this challenge the goal is to make the first deployment of a policy and a role assignment to show case the architecture approach from challenge 2. The central IT team at Contoso Land Surveying wants to get a better understanding how they can leverage the repository deployed in challenge 1 to assign policies and role assignments.

Use the enterprise scale documentation to go through the steps to present the assignment.
