In this challenge we want to talk about the landing zone and the first two CAF modules.

## Challenge 2 - learn more about the reference implementations

In this challenge you will make a whiteboard design session to find the best approach for Contoso to achieve the following objectives:

1. The platform landing zone must be able to ensure, that workloads deployed for the UK subsidiary will only be deployed in UK Azure DataCenter
2. An flexible and scalable network architecture to meet future expansion plans for other markets like US or Asia
3. The landing zone should provide the possibility that former local IT stuff is able to administrator and manage only Azure resources deployed for their region. Other IT stuff from other regions should be able to access the resources only with approval process. The central IT team should have access to all resources of any location.

### Whiteboard Design Session

Take a whiteboard and develop a architecture MVP for Contoso to meet all objectives and present your approach to the central IT Team at Contoso.  

**Learning Objectives:**

* Learn more about the use of management groups
